## How to use this program
To use this program, simply run main.py and either select a file by it's name (reccomended) or paste code into the console.

In order to run a file, it must be stored in this folder, or in a subfolder in this folder.

The filename must end with `.py`, so the program reads it correctly.

**WARNING: NOT ALL FILES WORK WITH THIS**
